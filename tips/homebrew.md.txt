All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.

A file that aliases these commands to their normal names is available
and may be used in your bashrc like:

    source /usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.12/aliases

But note that sourcing these aliases will cause them to be used instead
of Bash built-in commands, which may cause problems in shell scripts.
The Bash "printf" built-in behaves differently than gprintf, for instance,
which is known to cause problems with "bash-completion".

The man pages are still referenced with the g-prefix.
